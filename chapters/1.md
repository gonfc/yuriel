Bam!

Yuriel woke up with a start, hitting his head on a hard structure. A heavy sound rang throughout the small space.

His head throbbed in pain he unfelt in a long time, triggering his eyes open. A small yawn escaped his parched mouth, prompting a small trace of saliva to leak from the corner.

If this sight was shown outside it would likely surprise countless people. Due to recent changes in the world, there was almost no human capable of having a sound sleep lately.

Yuriel's head shifted a few centimeters sideways.

A small indent showed where Yuriel's head had previously hit the coffin. Besides it there were countless others, each one with a unique shape of a specific part of the human skull. This last indent was the biggest so far.

An invisible strangeness seeped out from inside the coffin. From outside, an almost traceless leak of air could be seen, flowing like a headless firefly restlessly drawing winding shapes inside the small room.

Yuriel's eyes opened.

The darkness dilated his eyes. He smiled as he stared at nothing in particular.

His smile, however, seemed a little strange. Inside, it hid a trace of anxiety as well as expectations.

As if he noticed something, his mouth strained a bit. A few moments later, a small sound reached his ears. A white noise approached slowly, with no particular pattern.

It was the air from earlier. Like a firefly entering a jar, it unexpectedly came back as quickly as it had previously  left. 

A light spread out within the darkness almost instantly. Yuriel's body was still, but his mind was not.

After a small breath, it reached the light once again to its previous state. this time, however, a faint light leaked outside from narrow grooves in in the coffin's inner walls.

Yuriel gestured a bit and the lid came off. He sat up, stretched a bit, and glanced at the bright room.

His fingers moved as he calculated the time to leave the place.

â€˜A coffin?'

Yuriel only now understood his current situation. Before, he only had a suspection of his current location, but his guess was unexpectedly wrong.

He sighed. Some behaviors were indeed a little laudable, but could also be seen as pointless in some ways. 

He closed his eyes, thinking of the past.

A few minutes stretched out amidst silence. The ten fingers never stopped moving; either it was the right hand, or the left hand. 

The air was still; dead, murky, but also comfortable.

After all, a coffin and its surroundings location are supposed to provide a safe haven in respice and comfort. Most dead men find no solace in bloodshed, and therefore graveyards and mausoleums are considered as sacred places.

Whether it is ten feet under soil, or in rare cases, above. In ancient times, particularly, some people seemed to have this hobby.
