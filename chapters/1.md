Bam!

Yuriel woke up with a start followed by a mettalic sound. He felt his head hitting a hard metallic structure. His limbs were limited by the enclosed space that appeared to be larger than his body by just a few dozen centimeters.

Assessing his body for the first time in decades, he felt a sharp pain flashing his brain, disappearing a couple of breaths later , leaving in its stead a small yawn that escaped his parched mouth, meekly prompting a small trace of saliva to leak from the corner of its lips.

Enjoying the last traces of complete darkness, Yuriel raised his hands up causing 

If this sight was shown outside it would likely surprise countless people. Due to recent changes in the world, there was almost no human capable of having a sound sleep lately.

Yuriel's head shifted a few centimeters sideways.

A small indent showed where Yuriel's head had previously hit the coffin. Besides it there were countless others, each one with a unique shape of a specific part of the human skull. This last indent was the biggest so far.

An invisible strangeness seeped out from inside the coffin. From outside, an almost traceless leak of air could be seen, flowing like a headless firefly restlessly drawing winding shapes inside the small room.

Yuriel's eyes opened.

The darkness dilated his eyes. He smiled as he stared at nothing in particular.

<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">His smile, however, seemed a little strange. Inside, it hid a trace of anxiety as well as expectations.</mark>

As if he noticed something, his mouth strained a bit. A few moments later, a small sound reached his ears. A white noise approached slowly, with no particular pattern.

It was the air from earlier. Like a firefly entering a jar, it unexpectedly came back as quickly as it had previously  left.

A light spread out within the darkness almost instantly. Yuriel's body was still, but his mind was not.

After a small breath, it reached the light once again to its previous state. this time, however, a faint light leaked outside from narrow grooves in in the coffin's inner walls.

Yuriel gestured a bit. A faint metallic pitch rang throughout the enclosed space as the lid came off. He sat up, stretched a bit. Every bend and pull echoed a small crack out of the stiff body parts..

He glanced at his surroundings. His fingers moved as he calculated something.

He was in a small room with no apparent windows. The walls had faint cracks. When he approached a section of the wall, strange runes with varying sizes spread for for a few seconds before fading again.

â€˜A coffin?'

Yuriel only now understood his current situation. Before, he only had a suspicion of his current location, but his guess was unexpectedly wrong.

He sighed. Some behaviors were indeed a little laudable, but others eere aleays able to point enough flaws just to deem it useless.

He closed his eyes, thinking of the past.

A few silent minutes passed by. The shadows in the corner seemed to be hiding from something, and only a few shades of dark could be seen across the entire room. 

The room was not big, its 10 meters across were just enough for the coffin not seem too lonely standing in the center of the white tiles.

Finally, there was a change in Yuriel's fingers. The five right hand's fingers that never stopped moving since the start cramped slightly and, throughout small tremors, formed a praying lotus shape where the pinky and middle touched themselves and the rest spread out in a seemingly natural order.  The left hand's fingers still moved restlessly.

Legend has it that after Nuwa shaped the first humans from clay, past buddhas and gods had aquired knowledge of order and chaos through meticulous study of human hand movement. 

Of course, compared to the vast knowledge of the universe and the most powerful divine beings, this litle trickle of understanding had no place to speak of.

Yuriel sneezed, creating the first air movement this room had for quite some time.

After all, a coffin and its surroundings location are supposed to provide a safe haven. Ths dead, and especially the ones who cannot reborn, require utmost respite and comfort. In the human world, graveyards and mausoleums are considered as sacred places.

A mid-sized coffin consoicuously olaced in the midddle of a plain room can also be considered stylish and sacred, right?

After a few glances back to the coffin, Yuriel simply turned the door handle and left the room casually.

As he exited the room, a few faces seemed to flash amidst the shadows. Some resembled pure and cold gods while others sememed more like fierce and lively demons.

As expected, next door had nothing extraordinary. It looked similar to a furnace room ancient alchemists studied and refined medicinal pills, often to please human kings or perhaps cultivate themselves quietly. Apart from a furnace, there were  miscellaneous household items such as a mantle,
