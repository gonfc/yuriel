Bam!

Yuriel woke up with a start, hitting his head on a hard structure. A heavy sound rang throughout the small space.

His head throbbed in pain he had not felt in a long time, triggering his eyes open. A small yawn escaped his parched mouth that had a small trace of saliva leaking out.

If this sight was shown outside, it would surprise countless people. Due to recent changes in the world, there was almost no human capable of having a sound sleep lately.

A small indent showed where Yuriel's head hit the coffin. Besides it there were countless others, each one the shape of some part of the human skull. This last one appeared to be the biggest so far, as if signaling something.

An invisible strangeness seeped out from somewhere inside the coffin. From outside, an almost invisible leak of air appeared, trapped inside the small room.

Yuriel's eyes opened. He smiled as he stared at nothing in particular.

His smile, however, seemed a little strange. Inside, it hid a trace of anxiety as well as expectations towards the world outside.

As if he noticed something, his mouth strained a bit. After a small breath, it reached back once again to its previous state.

â€˜A coffin?'

Yuriel understood his current situation. He sighed. Some behaviors were indeed a little laudable, but could also be seen as pointless in some ways. He closed his eyes, thinking of the past.

A few minutes stretched out amidst silence. The air was still; dead, murky, but also comfortable.

A coffin is supposed to be a comfortable home at ends' reach, after all. Whether it is ten feet under soil, or in rare cases, above. In ancient times, particularly, some people seemed to have this hobby.
